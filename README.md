# Supermarket Management System using Java
Everyday is a learning day !
The supermarket management system manages the classification of goods, the recording of suppliers and consumers, the recording of a large number of the order information, and their distribution information.

You all need to be familiar with Java in order to create this supermarket management system. This supermarket management system has two interfaces for customer and employee. Employees manage customer information, product information, supplier information, sales information from this system. Customers are able to add products to the cart and pay for products from this system. 

The technologies I've used :

Java
Text Editor - NetBeans
Database - MySQL

#### Thank You Guys & Good Luck!!
